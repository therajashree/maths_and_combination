Prime Number Algorithms and Sieve Techniques

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two distinct positive divisors — 1 and itself.

Basic Primality Check: To check if a number n is prime, try dividing it by numbers from 2 to n-1. If any number divides it, then n is not prime; otherwise, it is.

Optimized Method (Square Root Check): We only need to check up to √n because if n has a factor larger than √n, the corresponding smaller factor must be less than √n.

So if no number from 2 to √n divides n, then n is prime


Sieve of Eratosthenes: The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a given number n.

Note: It is much faster than checking each number individually using the basic method.


Prime Factorization Techniques:
Optimised Trial Division:

Try dividing n by all numbers up to √n, starting from 2.
After removing all factors of 2, check only odd numbers.
If n is still greater than 1, it's a prime factor itself.
Using Sieve + SPF (Smallest Prime Factor):

The sieve precomputes and stores the smallest prime factor (SPF) for every number up to n.
Then, to factorize any number, we repeatedly look up spf[n] and divide n by it, collecting the prime factors efficiently.
We can also count the number of Prime factors using this approach.

Number of Prime Factor:

If the prime factorization of a number n is: 
n=p 
1
e 
1
​
 
​
 ×p 
2
e 
2
​
 
​
 ×⋯×p 
k
e 
k
​
 
​
  Then the total number of divisors of n is:
(e 
1
​
 +1)×(e 
2
​
 +1)×⋯×(e 
k
​
 +1).

Each exponent eᵢ gives us (eᵢ + 1) choices (from pᵢ⁰ to pᵢ^eᵢ) in forming a divisor.

Multiplying all such choices gives the total number of divisors
